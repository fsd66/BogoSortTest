# BogoSortTest
Just a little python program to find the average time of how long it takes to bogosort a randomized list of specified length.

In case you would like to know, Bogosort is a sorting algorithm that first checks if a sequence is sorted, then shuffles the list if it is not, and repeats until the list is sorted.  This is analogous to putting a deck of cards in order by shuffling and checking it until it comes out in order.  As you might have guessed, this is a really inefficient way to sort any sequence, but it was fun to put this together and brush up my python.
